# 🧠 AI Tech Advisor

This project presents an AI-based **Technical Advisor assistant**, designed to simulate expert-level responses based on user queries in the field of technology. Built using a language model, this notebook showcases a prompt-based interaction system that can serve as a basic prototype for an AI-powered consulting tool.

## 📌 Project Objective

To demonstrate how a language model (LLM) can be used to:
- Respond to user queries on technical topics
- Simulate a conversational tech expert
- Explore prompt engineering and LLM interaction in a controlled notebook environment

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.11+**
- **OpenAI API** – for language model inference
- **Environment Variables (.env)** – to securely manage API keys

---

## 🚀 Features

- Modular prompt template creation
- Accepts dynamic user input
- Demonstrates conversational response from OpenAI's LLM

---

## 🔐 Setup Instructions

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install openai python-dotenv

2. **Set your OpenAI API key** 
   Create a .env file:  
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here

3. **Run the notebook**
Launch Jupyter Notebook and open AI_TechAdvisor.ipynb

---

## 📈 Future Enhancements
* Add multi-turn memory for longer conversations
* Deploy as a Flask or Streamlit web app
* Expand prompt templates to domain-specific advisors (e.g. legal, finance)
